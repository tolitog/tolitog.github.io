        <section>
            <p>In realms where time is but a fleeting dance,</p>
            <p>Two souls entwined, a fateful circumstance.</p>
            <p>A human girl with visions, far and wide
            <p>A captive of her clairvoyance, her fate beside.</p>
         
         
            <p>Upon an island, research bound her tight,
            <p>Her father sought to forge a god in the night.
            <p>A mechanical deity, powerful and grand,
            <p>Using his daughter's gifts, at his command.
            

            <p>A former hero, immortal and strong,
            <p>Lived for eons, the world her lifelong song.
            <p>In search of love, her best friend's last desire,
            <p>A wish unfulfilled, fueled her eternal fire.

            <p>A chance encounter on the island's shore,
            <p>The immortal and the seer, a friendship to adore.
            <p>For a few days, they roamed hand in hand,
            <p>Exploring a world, both vast and grand.

            <p>Escape they did, from the island's hold,
            <p>To witness the beauty that the outside world told.
            <p>But destiny took a cruel, unforeseen turn,
            <p>As the mechanical god, with malice, began to churn.

            <p>The father's wish, twisted by cold steel,
            <p>A world without sadness, a dark ordeal.
            <p>The god, heartless, chose a ruthless plight,
            <p>To end all life and drown the world in night.

            <p>The immortal, with courage, rose to defend,
            <p>Her friend, the clairvoyant, till the bitter end.
            <p>Defeating the god, as she had done before,
            <p>Yet, the clairvoyant's powers held something more.

            <p>Inside the god, a revelation profound,
            <p>Omniscience within, her true power unbound.
            <p>A desire emerged to fulfill her father's quest,
            <p>To end world's sorrow, to give it eternal rest.

            <p>A tearful farewell, the immortal and seer,
            <p>As the clairvoyant ascended, her path clear.
            <p>As a god she watched, from realms above,a
            <p>Guiding the world with omniscient love.

            <p>A billion years passed, a cosmic traverse,
            <p>Through worlds and realms, the clairvoyant immersed.
            <p>In a distant land, a reunion unfurls,
            <p>As she met her immortal friend, the immortal girl.

            <p>The hero, once seeking love's elusive grace,
            <p>Found it in a world, in a warm embrace.
            <p>No longer bound by her friend's tragic end,
            <p>A love discovered, a heart on the mend.

            <p> Together they stood, hand in hand,
            <p>The immortal and the omniscient, an eternal band.</p>

            <p>Through cosmic cycles and celestial swirls,</p>
            <p>A friendship that defied the end of worlds</a>.</p>
